Configuring resource requests and limits for workloads running in Kubernetes helps ensure that every container will have access to all the resources it needs. These are also a crucial part of cluster autoscaling logic, as new nodes are only spun up when there is insufficient capacity on existing infrastructure for new pod(s). By default, Polaris validates that resource requests and limits are set, it also includes optional functionality to ensure these requests and limits fall within specified ranges.
