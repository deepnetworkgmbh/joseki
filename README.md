# Joseki

*Joseki* is a set of services to help you keeping cloud-infrastructure, kubernetes, and docker-images configuration closer to known best-practices.

The project integrates multiple open-sourced tools:

- Container Image vulnerabilities scanner [trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy).
- Kubernetes objects validator [polaris](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/polaris).
- Cloud infrastructure auditor [az-sk](https://github.com/azsk/DevOpsKit)

More are coming ;) Take a look on the project [Overview](./PRODUCTOVERVIEW.md), [Technical Design](./TECH_DESIGN.md), and [Roadmap](./PRODUCTOVERVIEW.md#roadmap).
